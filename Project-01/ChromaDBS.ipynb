After gaining independence in 1947, India adopted its Constitution on 26 January 1950, establishing itself as a **sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic**. The core principle of Indian democracy is that power ultimately lies with the people, who exercise it through their elected representatives.\\n\\nIndia follows a **parliamentary form of government**, similar to the British model, where the President is the constitutional head of the state, and the Prime Minister along with the Council of Ministers holds real executive power. The Parliament, consisting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, makes laws and represents the voice of the citizens.\\n\\nA major strength of Indian democracy is its **universal adult franchise**, which grants every citizen above 18 years the right to vote, irrespective of caste, religion, gender, or economic status. This ensures inclusiveness and equal participation in the political process. Free and fair elections are conducted by an independent Election Commission, which stands as a guardian of democratic values.\\n\\nThe **judiciary** in India acts as the protector of the Constitution and fundamental rights. It ensures that the government functions within the limits of the Constitution. The separation of powers among the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary strengthens democratic stability.\\n\\nIndian democracy celebrates diversity. Despite having numerous languages, religions, and cultures, the democratic framework promotes unity, secularism, and social justice. Various institutions like the media, civil society organizations, and the Right to Information (RTI) Act empower citizens and keep the government accountable.\\n\\nHowever, challenges such as corruption, caste-based politics, and social inequalities still exist. Yet, India continues to strive toward a more transparent and participative democracy.\\n\\nIn essence, Indian democracy is a dynamic system that reflects the will of the people and upholds the ideals of freedom, equality, and justice.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet me know if you want it in simpler language, more formal, or in point format!\\n')]"
